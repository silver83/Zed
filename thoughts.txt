* generically define dependencies
* dep may define a relationship
* projects have components
* component = .netConfig/StructuremapConfig/IIS mapping/winservice record/
* must identify file types ! (structure map configuration/.net configuration/other) generically
* must provide fuzzy match allowing user intervension (I think its either structuremap or ninject, tell me)
* dep definition should be simple
* deps I want to verify:
	* wcf endpoints
	* msmq queues
	* assembly refs (from config or from dll meta)
